# WMS (Warehouse Management System) Application

## Overview
This is a Flask-based Warehouse Management System with SAP B1 integration. The application provides inventory management, transfer operations, barcode generation, and invoice creation functionality.

## Project Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Replit managed database)
- **Frontend**: HTML templates with Bootstrap styling
- **Integration**: SAP Business One API integration
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login for user management

## Current Configuration
- **Port**: 5000 (configured for Replit webview)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with automatic table creation
- **Environment**: Production-ready with gunicorn server
- **Logging**: File-based logging system enabled

## Key Features
- User authentication and role management
- Inventory transfer operations
- Barcode and QR code generation
- SAP B1 integration for warehouse operations
- Serial number tracking
- Invoice creation module
- Pick list management
- GRPO (Goods Receipt PO) functionality

## Credential Configuration
The application now uses JSON-based credential management exclusively for better security and configuration management:

### JSON Credential File Format
Location: `C:/tmp/sap_login/credential.json` (Primary) or `/tmp/sap_login/credential.json` (Linux fallback)

```json
{
   "SAP_B1_SERVER": "https://your-sap-server:50000",
   "SAP_B1_USERNAME": "your_username",
   "SAP_B1_PASSWORD": "your_password",
   "SAP_B1_COMPANY_DB": "your_company_db",
   "MYSQL_HOST": "localhost",
   "MYSQL_PORT": "3306",
   "MYSQL_USER": "your_db_user",
   "MYSQL_PASSWORD": "your_db_password",
   "MYSQL_DATABASE": "your_database",
   "DATABASE_URL": "mysql+pymysql://user:password@host:port/database"
}
```

### Credential Loading Behavior
- **Primary Source**: JSON file from `C:/tmp/sap_login/credential.json`
- **Fallback**: Environment variables only if JSON file is not found
- **Database**: MySQL from JSON credentials with PostgreSQL fallback for Replit environment
- **SAP B1 Integration**: All credentials loaded from JSON file, including SAPIntegration class
